 The date input type is not supported in all browsers. Please be sure to test, and consider using a polyfill.
From line 58, column 29; to line 58, column 87
          <input type="date" name="bday" value="1970-01-01" disabled>â†©     

This is the only warning we have. As we know what browser is going to be used, we have decided to still using date type.
